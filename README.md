Please this contains all of the 
* Java files 
* Java docs and the

You can run the application from the "gui" -> "App.java"
The username and password are found in the "package model" -> "Database.java" -> "line 44".



JavaSwingDBApp.jar

I have also exported the program to executable .jar file.
Please I suggest that you update all Java JDK and JRE.
Currently I am using JDK 1.8.0_60.
